## Project Synthesis
The theme of our project involves the application of Laplace Operators in edge detection/contouring (automatic generation of convolution masks of various dimensions). The Laplace operator is a second-order differential operator in an n-dimensional Euclidean space. Due to its high processing speed, the chosen theme optimally aligns with practical use.

## Introduction
The project implements edge detection using the Laplacian operator. The input comprises a grayscale image, and the operator's size ranges from (3x3, 5x5, 7x7, etc). The automated parameters of the operator contribute to the generation of convolution masks of different dimensions.

## Output
The output of the project comprises the original image along with its histogram, the gradient image, and the binary edge-detected image. The project demonstrates the visual presentation of the image after each step of the process.

## Theoretical Overview
The edge detection algorithm relies on detecting the second-order derivative's zero crossings, allowing for precise edge detection regardless of rapid changes in luminosity. Laplacian operators are critical in image processing, computer vision, and machine vision applications.

## Project Implementation
The project starts with an introduction to the theory followed by the step-by-step practical implementation using image libraries and algorithms.

## Code and Implementation
The code is divided into sections, from applying convolution masks to zero-crossing determinations to visualizing the intermediate results. Both pre-existing libraries and step-by-step manual implementation were used for a comparative study.

## Experimental Results
The project's codes provided the following experimental outcomes:

- Original Image
- Image Post Convolution
- Zero-Crossing Image

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the project was successfully implemented and could be further improved through deeper exploration and additional work. Though of moderate difficulty, the team efficiently collaborated to achieve the project's objectives. The final results may require refinement, as the final image display appears excessively dense.
